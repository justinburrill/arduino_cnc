# arduino_cnc
Program for a cnc-like arduino machine to draw images on a paper with a pen.
Most arduino files are for testing and all python files are unused. The original plan was to allow the user to input images, which were converted 
into black and white (1s and 0s) and sent to the arduino via serial. This was cut due to time constraints.
